# Warmup

The purpose of this task is just to have a little warmup and check if everything operates.

Please make yourself aware of the server and client code. We will run those using docker-compose.

```
docker-compose build && docker-compose up
```

You can check if the app operates as anticipated by making a query yourself. Try following commands:

```
curl http://localhost:8080/
curl http://localhost:8080/12
curl http://localhost:8080/bad
```
