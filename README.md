# OpenTelemetry Workshop

## What is OpenTelemetry

Short presentation on what is OpenTelemetry in general, what it can be used for: [Observability 2.0 vs OpenTelemetry](https://slides.com/perk/obsevability-20-feat-opentelemetry)

## Data creation

* Manual instrumentation: write a simple application which creates logs, metrics and traces using the OpenTelemetry libraries

* Autoinstrumentation: Pet Clinic

## Data collection
